# Stopwatch AgentBezel C152

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**Stopwatch AgentBezel C152** is an independent, unofficial, open-source
three-workspace control surface for the **M5Stack StopWatch Dev Kit C152**:
Codex Micro compatibility, super.engineering project controls, and Hermes
Desktop session controls, with a local quota dashboard and optional USB microphone.

Codex Micro compatibility is experimental and undocumented. Runtime names,
pairing identities, audio selection and the local Companion identity remain
unchanged. New three-app behavior requires matching source builds; physical
acceptance of this revision is pending.

## Three workspaces

These are native framebuffer design previews, not hardware photographs.

**Swipe left to cycle: Codex / ChatGPT → SUPER → HERMES → Codex / ChatGPT.**
The current Codex / ChatGPT entry uses `com.openai.codex`; it is one target,
not two. From an unrelated foreground app, left first enters Codex.
Missing or rejected targets are not skipped. The former “return to previous
app” behavior is replaced by this fixed cycle.

| Input | Codex Micro | SUPER | HERMES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Left physical / right physical / center tap | Push to talk / Voice Chat / Send | No action¹ | No action¹ |
| Swipe left | Enter SUPER | Enter HERMES | Enter Codex |
| Swipe up | Existing app mapping | Previous project | Previous session Tab |
| Swipe down | Existing app mapping | Next project | Next session Tab |
| Swipe right | Existing app mapping | Next session Tab | Open highlighted session |
| Power controls | Desk sleep / Travel Mode | Same | Same |

¹ Directional screens and device-side isolation require the explicitly chosen
matching `usb-mic` firmware. The default wireless image remains a Codex panel.
Companion direction handling requires a real `--watch` process.

## Codex Micro workspace

The default dashboard shows Agent state, weekly Codex allowance, reset
countdown, battery and charging/Dock state, and whether Codex, BLE, and quota
sync are healthy. A completed Agent turns green and plays a soft completion
chime. The left physical button is Push to talk, the right button is Voice
Chat, the center dial is Send, and up/down/right remain configurable in ChatGPT Desktop; left is reserved for
workspace cycling while the Companion runs in real watch mode. Physical buttons and touch gestures use
haptics.

The compatible `Codex Micro` BLE HID channel carries controls. The local quota
companion uses a separate, project-owned BLE GATT service, so the watch never
stores an OpenAI token. The installed ChatGPT Desktop version used during
development exposed one Mic key rather than separate `ACT10` and `ACT11`
assignments: the right button intentionally sends configurable `ACT09`
(`Command Key 4`), not `ACT11`.

On battery, the display dims after two minutes and enters desk sleep after five;
Dock Mode extends those intervals to ten and thirty minutes. Desk sleep keeps
BLE alerts alive. Double-click the red power button for firmware-confirmed
Travel Mode shutdown; power button or USB wakes it. A six-second center hold is
a deliberately slower Travel Mode fallback with a missed-alert warning. Physical
power switching soak testing is still pending, so timings and wake behavior are
experimental until that checklist is complete.

## super.engineering workspace

Use the exact bundle `com.zarifpour.superconductor`. Configure these app
shortcuts: Previous Project = `Control-Option-Up`, Next Project =
`Control-Option-Down`, Next Tab = `Control-Option-Right`.
Up/down/right are sent only to that exact foreground process. Left advances to
Hermes; it does not return to an arbitrary previous app.

## Hermes Desktop workspace

Use the exact native app bundle `com.nousresearch.hermes`, not a CLI, web
dashboard or installer. Up sends `Control-Shift-Tab`, down sends
`Control-Tab`, retaining the [native Desktop browsing shortcuts](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/desktop#windows-tabs--panes).
When the central session picker is visible, browse with up/down and swipe right
to open the highlighted session. Right sends a Control press/release pair,
ending with no modifier flags; the tested Hermes 0.17.0 picker commits on Control
release. It does not send Return or Command-T, so right is no longer New Tab.
Verify the behavior with a physical keyboard on your Hermes version before
installation. Native browsing can depend on the focused Tab region; it is not
project-tree-order navigation. No Hermes plugin or source extension is required.
The Companion does not inspect the picker, read/change Hermes settings or
session data, or retry confirmation. Physical right-swipe acceptance is separate
from verifying the native keyboard action.

## Shared workspace setup and screen behavior

1. Install the three target desktop apps. Assign each to a normal macOS Space
   manually using **Dock → Options → Assign To → This Desktop** if desired.
   The Companion activates apps; it does not create/enumerate Spaces or select
   a particular window.
2. Enable Input Monitoring and Accessibility for the installed
   `CodexWatchCompanion.app`; retain Bluetooth permission for quota sync.
3. Leave **Analog stick left** unbound in ChatGPT's controller settings.
   Preserve the existing up/down/right mappings. Restart the original
   Companion LaunchAgent after any permission change.
4. Install matching Companion and explicitly chosen USB-mic firmware only
   after source validation, backups and exact-port flash confirmation.

SUPER/HERMES share four outward triangles, with no independent center outline.
Every accepted local swipe picks four distinct colors from a 12-color pool;
each direction changes from its previous color. Text colors remain stable.
Palette feedback has its own 800ms cooldown; redraw, heartbeat, quota updates
and Dock/Command-Tab changes do not recolor. This is local input feedback, not
proof that the Mac accepted a shortcut.

The display follows actual foreground activation, with a 5-second heartbeat
and a 15-second connection-owned lease. Leaving the two directional apps sends
Codex; failed Codex writes get at most two further 5-second retries. Losing the
lease or owner connection restores Codex. Foreground updates never wake the
screen. Disabled short taps/physical controls do not wake directional screens;
a genuine swipe wakes without also issuing an unseen action. Center long-hold
and red-button power behavior remain available.

SUPER/HERMES block Agent, Send and ChatGPT microphone/voice button actions;
mode transitions release held controls and suppress stale completion notices.
The USB microphone endpoint remains available. MainActor routing revalidates
the exact foreground PID/bundle before fixed process-targeted key delivery;
no global key injection or application-content reading is used.

### Physical acceptance still required

Verify one full left-swipe cycle, cold app launch, failure/no-skip, assigned
Spaces, all app-specific directions, 800ms gating, random colors, sleep/wake,
input isolation, no background ChatGPT actions, 15-second fallback, reconnect,
USB microphone capture, quota updates and original automatic startup.
Builds and native previews alone do not establish C152 hardware success.

## Recommended installation

This is a source-build project: no prebuilt macOS app, DMG, or PKG is
distributed. The recommended path is to open this repository locally in Codex
on the Bluetooth-capable Mac that will pair with the C152. It requires macOS
14+, Swift 5.10+ (Xcode 15.3 Command Line Tools+), PlatformIO Core, a
data-capable USB-C cable for the first flash, and a signed-in ChatGPT Desktop
with Codex Micro support. This port supports **M5Stack StopWatch Dev Kit, SKU
C152** only; other M5Stack devices are unsupported.

Connect the C152, do not guess its serial port, and paste this into Codex:

```text
Install this project on my physical M5Stack StopWatch Dev Kit C152.

Read AGENTS.md and README.md completely before acting. Work through the setup
autonomously, but follow these safety rules:

1. Start with read-only checks. Confirm macOS, the C152 target, available build
   tools, and the exact newly connected serial device.
2. Do not build or enable any microphone, USB Audio, BLE Audio, diagnostics, or
   other deferred experiment. Use only the m5stack-stopwatch firmware target.
3. Explain any missing dependency before installing it. Never ask me for an
   OpenAI API key, login cookie, access token, or other credential.
4. Show me the official M5Stack factory-recovery link and build the firmware
   before attempting an upload.
5. Immediately before flashing, report the exact /dev/cu.* port you resolved
   and ask me to confirm that one destructive device action.
6. After flashing, verify the CODEX_MICRO_STOPWATCH_READY marker with
   `python3 scripts/serial_probe.py <the exact port> --seconds 30 --expect
   CODEX_MICRO_STOPWATCH_READY`, then guide me through macOS Bluetooth pairing.
7. Help me grant ChatGPT Input Monitoring and configure ChatGPT Desktop: left
   button = Push to talk, Command Key 4 = Toggle voice chat, center = Send, and
   keep up/down/right configurable and leave left unbound for watch-mode cycling.
8. Build the Swift quota companion from source. Use demo discovery to find this
   Mac's CoreBluetooth UUID, then bind real quota writes to that exact device.
9. If I approve automatic startup, create the local app wrapper and LaunchAgent
   only on this Mac. Keep generated paths, UUIDs, logs, and app files out of Git.
10. Verify buttons, center Send, four swipes, Agent colors, completion chime,
    haptics, and a real quota/reset update separately. Report anything not
    physically observed as unverified.
11. Only if I explicitly choose the optional SUPER/HERMES phase, guide me
    through its Space, shortcuts, and acceptance checks. Do not silently enable
    Accessibility, edit SUPER/Hermes settings, or assign a Space.
12. Do not select or flash the optional USB microphone image unless I explicitly
    choose that separate phase.
```

The repository's [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) provides durable installation and
privacy boundaries. Claude Code and other local coding agents can follow the
same instructions, but Codex is the documented default.

## macOS permissions and app configuration

Codex handles terminal work; the user still approves missing tools and the
exact flash, pairs **Codex Micro** in **System Settings > Bluetooth**, and
allows **ChatGPT** in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input
Monitoring** before quitting and reopening ChatGPT. Configure the actions in
**ChatGPT Desktop > Settings > Codex Micro**. The base installation needs
Bluetooth access for the locally built companion; the optional
SUPER/HERMES phase additionally needs Input Monitoring and Accessibility
for `CodexWatchCompanion.app`.

Build the quota companion from source, run demo discovery, and bind real writes
only to the CoreBluetooth UUID printed by that Mac. Keep the `--watch` process
running unless automatic startup is installed. With approval, a locally built
wrapper and per-user LaunchAgent can provide automatic startup; generated app
files, paths, UUIDs, and logs remain local. The LaunchAgent template identity is
`io.github.codex-micro-stopwatch.companion` and the executable remains
`codex-watch-companion`.

If macOS caches an older HID descriptor after changing images, forget only the
StopWatch's **Codex Micro** pairing and pair it again. Keep a real Codex
Micro's pairing record, but disconnect or power it off while validating this
port: one active Micro is supported at a time.

## Optional USB microphone

The default `m5stack-stopwatch` image uses the Mac microphone. Users who
explicitly choose the isolated `usb-mic` build can expose the StopWatch as
**Codex StopWatch Mic**: 48 kHz, 16-bit, mono, input-only USB Audio. It has no
USB speaker/output endpoint. BLE controls and the dashboard remain included;
the local completion chime plays only while the Mac is not streaming microphone
audio. Keep USB connected while recording, select **Codex StopWatch Mic** in
**System Settings > Sound > Input**, and keep Push to talk and Voice Chat
actions on Bluetooth while audio samples travel over USB.

Build this separate target with `pio run -d usb-mic`; explain its first-build
toolchain download, time, and disk cost before starting. Follow the same
factory-recovery and exact-port confirmation rules. Afterward, do not expect
the default serial READY marker: verify the selected **Codex StopWatch Mic**
input, verify BLE/HID separately, and make a short local recording test. Do
not commit recordings, device identifiers, or local paths.

## Privacy and architecture

The Swift `CodexWatchCompanion` starts a local Codex App Server with the
user's existing signed-in context and reads `account/rateLimits/read`. It sends
only remaining percentage and reset countdown over the project-owned quota
GATT service to the explicitly bound watch. The compatible HID interface does
not include account rate limits.

In a real `--watch` run, the optional workspace integration additionally sends
only the fixed `codex`, `super` or `hermes` display-mode enum over vendor HID Report ID
6. It does not send API keys, tokens, account identifiers, prompts, task text,
audio, project/session/window/Space metadata, or user content. It does not
scrape UI, use a cloud relay, inspect keyboard text, invoke shell commands or
AppleScript, use private Space APIs, or inspect super.engineering or Hermes settings.

Device MAC addresses, CoreBluetooth UUIDs, usernames, home-directory paths,
and logs are local installation data and must never be committed. BLE pairing
uses the platform's Just Works flow without passkey authentication: use the
project in a trusted environment and remove stale pairings when a Mac or watch
changes owner. See [the companion documentation](companion/README.md) and the
[GATT contract](docs/COMPANION_PROTOCOL.md).

## Manual build and flash

The Codex-assisted flow is recommended. Maintainers can use
[PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html):

```sh
pio run -e m5stack-stopwatch
pio device list
```

Identify the exact serial device that appeared for the connected C152. Build
first, read M5Stack's [official StopWatch factory-recovery guide](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/guide/restore_factory/stopwatch),
and only then flash the resolved port after explicit confirmation:

```sh
pio run -e m5stack-stopwatch --target upload --upload-port /dev/cu.YOUR_C152_PORT
```

Never copy a port from another user's documentation. A successful default boot
prints `CODEX_MICRO_STOPWATCH_READY`; verify it against that same port:

```sh
python3 scripts/serial_probe.py /dev/cu.YOUR_C152_PORT --seconds 30 \
  --expect CODEX_MICRO_STOPWATCH_READY
```

For the optional USB-mic image, use the same recovery and exact-port safeguards:

```sh
pio run -d usb-mic
pio run -d usb-mic -e m5stack-stopwatch-usb-mic --target upload \
  --upload-port /dev/cu.YOUR_C152_PORT
```

The USB-mic image replaces normal USB serial with audio, so no
`CODEX_MICRO_STOPWATCH_READY` is expected. Later updates can use the
companion's encrypted `--enter-bootloader` command, then must rediscover and
confirm the newly enumerated port; M5Stack's manual recovery gesture remains
the fallback.

To run the quota companion manually:

```sh
cd companion
swift build -c release

# Demo data only; prints the UUID seen by this Mac.
.build/release/codex-watch-companion --demo --verbose

# Replace the placeholder locally. Never commit the resulting UUID.
.build/release/codex-watch-companion \
  --device-id YOUR_COREBLUETOOTH_UUID --watch --interval 60
```

## Troubleshooting

### The C152 does not appear as a serial device

- Try a known data-capable USB-C cable and another port.
- Disconnect other development boards, list ports again, and reconnect only the
  C152.
- If installed firmware cannot boot, follow M5Stack's official download-mode
  and factory-recovery instructions.

### Codex Micro does not appear in Bluetooth settings

- Restart the watch and scan again.
- Forget an old **Codex Micro** pairing before retrying.
- For the default image, confirm `CODEX_MICRO_STOPWATCH_READY` over serial. For
  USB-mic, verify its audio interface and BLE/HID independently.

### ChatGPT sees the Micro but controls do nothing

- Allow ChatGPT in Input Monitoring, then quit and reopen it.
- Disconnect any other active Codex Micro.
- Temporarily quit keyboard remappers or security tools that may claim or block
  HID, then reconnect.

### The right button does not open Voice Chat

Assign **Command Key 4** to **Toggle voice chat** in ChatGPT Desktop. The
button sends `ACT09`, not `ACT11`.

### The screen says `SYNCING MAC` or quota is stale

- Confirm the companion runs on the paired Mac.
- Re-run demo discovery and bind the exact UUID printed on that Mac.
- Do not copy a UUID from another computer: CoreBluetooth identifiers are local
  to the host.

### Optional workspace navigation does not work

- Confirm the foreground bundle is `com.zarifpour.superconductor` or
  `com.nousresearch.hermes`, the corresponding
  fixed shortcuts work from the physical keyboard, and Accessibility is enabled
  for `CodexWatchCompanion.app`.
- Input Monitoring is required to receive radial gestures. If Accessibility is
  missing, only project/tab navigation is disabled; left cycling, quota,
  and USB microphone input remain available.
